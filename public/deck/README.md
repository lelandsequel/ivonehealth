# Deck images

Place the slide images in this folder using these filenames:

1. `01_activity_vs_outcomes.png` — “Core Problem With Traditional SEO”
2. `02_layered_system.png` — “SEO Is Infrastructure, Not Content” (layered system)
3. `03_pseo_template_data_pages.png` — “One Structure, Many Compliant Pages”
4. `04_bad_vs_good_pseo.png` — “Why Most pSEO Fails”
5. `05_ai_search_flow.png` — “AEO: Answer Engine Optimization”
6. `06_compounding_authority.png` — “Why This Compounds”
7. `07_timeline_30_90_180.png` — “What Success Looks Like”

Note: the AEO slide image may include a medical example question because this deck explains the SEO system built for a healthcare business; the deck copy itself should remain about the SEO OS (not treatment education).
